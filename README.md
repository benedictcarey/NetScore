# NetScore
NetScore is an extension of the existing MaxScore pacKage (Hajdu, Didkovsky) which adds new functionality for the rapid transmission and display of music notation on remote devices through standard modern browsers with WebSocket support. This was seen as a necessary devel-opment for MaxScore due to the ubiquity of tablets and other mobile devices, among other advantages for the user, and future applications of the software. We chose a server based solution executed in Java using the Jetty library for both portability between different platforms, and scalability. Novel applications facilitated by NetScore include transmitting scores generated in Max/MSP into virtual reality interfaces and more conven-ient performance/ rehearsal of real-time generated music, whereby devices commonly on hand such as smartphones, tablets and laptops are used as e-scores without requiring the installation of additional software.
